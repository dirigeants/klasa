## Schema

Schemas are the blueprints of how you want your settings setup. They are yours and Klasa's guide for ensuring that any operation done on settings is done correctly.

## Folders

### Adding a Folder

When working with schemas, it's very easy for yours to become unorganized or hard to manage. This is where folders come in. You can use Folders to group similar keys together to make it much easier to manage and read. Below is an example of how to add a folder to a schema.

```javascript
const { Client } = require('klasa');

Client.defaultGuildSchema
	// Let's add a moderation folder
	.add('moderation', modFolder => {
		// Moderation Role
		modFolder.add('role', 'role');
		// Moderation channel
		modFolder.add('channel', 'textchannel');
	});
```

To use both of these newly created keys, you would update `moderation.role` and `moderation.channel` with a role and channel, respectively.

You can also add a folder inside of another folder, allowing you to finely tune your Schema exactly to your likings.

### Adding a Piece

The function for adding a piece takes three arguments.

- A name for the key
- A type for the key
- Options object for the key

Below is an example of adding a piece. You can find further explanation of Pieces in the next section.

```javascript
const { Client } = require('klasa');

Client.defaultGuildSchema
	// Most of the options are defaulted to what they are here,
	// but for example purposes we'll leave them.
	.add('musicChannel', 'textchannel',
		{ array: false, default: null });
```

<!-- Added extra line on options object to remove scrollbar -->

Alternatively, if you wanted multiple channels for music you could set the key as an array instead.

```javascript
const { Client } = require('klasa');

Client.defaultGuildSchema
	.add('musicChannel', 'textchannel', { array: true, default: [] });
```

Now this key would be an array, and you could add multiple channels to it.

### Naming Conflicts

Whenever adding keys that have the same name, the Schema will automatically edit the requested key with the new properties you want. This allows you to edit core keys to your liking. Possible issues can crop when using this though, such as editing a prefix key to be a channel instead of the string it should be. Caution should be used when editing core keys.

The add function will automatically edit for you when the key is found. You can also get the key directly from the SchemaFolder it is on  and call .edit() on it manually.

## Pieces

Pieces are the individual keys that you will be setting when using Settings. Each key can have multiple different options, and core keys can be overwritten to your liking.

### Types

By default, there are several built-in types that the developer can use, and with the possibility to add custom types via {@link Serializer}s as explained below. The built-in types are:

| Name                | Type                                              | Description                                                                              |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **any**             | Anything, no type restriction                     | Resolves anything, even objects. The usage of this type will make a key unconfigurable   |
| **boolean**         | A {@link Boolean} resolvable                      | Resolves a boolean primitive value                                                       |
| **categorychannel** | A {@link external:CategoryChannel} instance or id | Resolves a CategoryChannel                                                               |
| **channel**         | A {@link external:Channel} instance or id         | Resolves a channel. Be careful with using this, as it accepts any type of channel        |
| **command**         | A {@link Command} instance or name                | Resolves a Command                                                                       |
| **float**           | A floating point number                           | Resolves a [float](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-precision_floating-point_format) |
| **guild**           | A {@link KlasaGuild} instance or id               | Resolves a KlasaGuild (which extends Guild)                                              |
| **integer**         | An integer number                                 | Resolves an [integer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integer) number                      |
| **language**        | A {@link Language} instance or name               | Resolves a language                                                                      |
| **number**          | A number                                          | Resolves a [float](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-precision_floating-point_format) |
| **role**            | A {@link external:Role} instance or id            | Resolves a Role                                                                          |
| **string**          | A {@link external:StringResolvable}               | Resolves a string                                                                        |
| **textchannel**     | A {@link external:TextChannel} instance or id     | Resolves a TextChannel                                                                   |
| **url**             | A URL resolvable                                  | Resolves a URL with Node.js' URL parser                                                  |
| **user**            | A {@link KlasaUser} instance or id                | Resolves a KlasaUser (which extends User)                                                |

### Custom Types

To add new types, you make a class, extending {@link Serializer}. The following serializer is a template for this:

```javascript
const { Serializer } = require('klasa');

// Extend Serializer to create your own. These are loaded from  the Serializers folder.
module.exports = class extends Serializer {

	constructor(...args) {
		// If you want aliases for this, you can set them here.
		super(...args, { aliases: [] });
	}

	// This function is used to tell Settings what this data is actually representing
	deserialize(data) {
		// Assuming data is stored in milliseconds
		// We can turn this date, given from your database, into a readable date.
		// new Date Object with our specified data
		return new Date(data);
	}

	// This function is used to tell Settings what this data should be stored as
	serialize(value) {
		// Convert Date Object back into milliseconds so it can be stored by the database.
		// Value here is our Date Object from deserialized.
		return value.getTime();
	}

	// This function is used to tell Settings what we should display the deserialized data as.
	stringify(value) {
		// Value here is our Date Object from deserialized
		return value.toDateString();
	}

};
```

**All serializers must resolve values into primitives or storable plain objects, otherwise, the provider may have issues with storing the value.**

## Options

Below is a list of all schema piece options that can be configured when adding or modifying pieces. You can find the full documentation at {@link SchemaEntryOptions}.

{@typedef SchemaEntryOptions}

### Default option

*The default option is optional, but, what is its default value?*

The default option is one of the last options to default, **array** defaults to `false`, **max** and **min** defaults to `null`, **configurable** defaults to either `true` or `false`, the latter if **type** is `any`; and **type** is always obligatory.

- If **array** is true, default will be an empty array: `[]`.
- If **type** is boolean, default will be `false`.
- In any other case, it will be `null`.

### Filter option

The filter option serves to blacklist certain values. It's output is not used, but any thrown error will be handled by SettingsGateway's internals and displayed to the caller (for example in the conf command, it would display the message to the user). It also must be synchronous.

Internally, we use this option to avoid users from disabling guarded commands (check {@link Command#guard}):

```javascript
const filter = (client, command, entry, language) => {
	if (command.guarded) throw language.get('COMMAND_CONF_GUARDED', command.name);
};

```

In this case, `client` is the {@link KlasaClient} instance, `command` the resolved command (the output from the command's SchemaType), `piece` is a {@link SchemaEntry} instance, and guild is a {@link Guild} instance, which may be null.

### Resolve option

The resolve option allows you specify whether or not you want your primitive values turned back into their full objects (where possible, ex: Turning User ID => User Object). When using the resolve method, this option will determine whether or not you get back a primitive or not. This option is true by default, and will automatically resolve every single object in array where possible.

An example: You have a roles array that gives certain roles permissions to use more commands. You want to check if a user has any of the roles in the array.

```javascript
const { Client } = require('klasa');

// Resolve is default by true, here for example purposes
Client.defaultGuildSchema.add('roles', 'role', { array: true, resolve: true });

// Assuming you're running this command in a guild, can also be awaited and destructured.
// Using this function you can expect 1 of 2 outcomes
// 1. You will get a resolved role back from the output which you can use just like any other role object.
// 2. You will get null back which indicates, for whatever reason, that the key could not be converted back to a role object.
// Since our key is an array, this will resolve all roles inside that array.
message.guild.settings.resolve('roles').then(resolved => console.log(resolved));
```

The above code is functionally equivalent to this:

```javascript
const { Client } = require('klasa');

Client.defaultGuildSchema.add('roles', 'role', { array: true });

// Array of Role Objects
const roles = message.guild.settings.get('roles').map(role => message.guild.roles.get(role));
```

> Note: Any key that cannot be resolved to its full object will be set to null to ensure falsy checks work as intended.

## Settings

They are maps that mirror the schemas with the values, they are always filled with all the elements from it, using schema's default values if no value is available in the database, this allows safety as the keys will always exist if they are defined in the schemas. The two most basic actions are:

### Getting a Value

Using {@link Settings#get}, we give it a path:

```javascript
// Get the prefix from the guild
message.guild.settings.get('prefix');
```

When using nested groups, we separate the groups names by dot:

```javascript
// Get the value from the administrator key from the roles group
message.guild.settings.get('roles.administrator');
```

You can use the pluck method to get multiple keys at once. It will return an array in the same order as the paths you gave it.

```javascript
const [prefix, adminRole] = message.guild.settings.pluck('prefix', 'roles.administrator');
```

If you would like resolved values as well, you can use the resolve method instead, it follows the same format as pluck, except that non-resolvable keys will be set to null in the returned array.

```javascript
// Can also be awaited and destructured
// Output: Role Object or null if unresolvable
message.guild.resolve('roles.administrator').then(resolvedArray => console.log(resolvedArray[0]));
```

### Updating or Resetting a Value

Using {@link Settings#update}, or {@link Settings#reset} to restore a value to its default:

```javascript
// Set the prefix to $
message.guild.settings.update('prefix', '$');

// Reset the prefix to its default value
message.guild.settings.reset('prefix');
```

We can also reset a group, or the entire settings instance, though for the latter, destroying it is more efficient:

```javascript
// Reset the roles group
message.guild.settings.reset('roles');

// Reset all the settings
message.guild.settings.reset();

// Or more efficiently (also deletes the entry from the database)
message.guild.settings.destroy();
```

> **Note**: When sharding, user and client settings are updated in all shards.

## Gateways

They are the central controllers that manage a table from the database with its own schema and cache. Each gateway is registered in a driver that ensures everything initializes correctly, this driver is called {@link GatewayDriver}, and we will use it to both register, and access to our gateways.

There are three built-in gateways: `clientStorage` (per-client settings), `guilds` (per-guild settings), and `users` (per-user settings). There are more available as plugins, for example: [KlasaMemberGateway  (per-member settings)](/#/docs/klasa-member-gateway/master/Getting%20Started/GettingStarted).

### Custom Gateway

```javascript
const { KlasaClient, Gateway } = require('klasa');

// Create the client
const client = new KlasaClient();

// Create the gateway
const gateway = new Gateway(client, 'channels');

// Register the gateway
client.gateways.register(gateway);

// Access to the gateway
client.gateways.get('channels');

// Login the bot
client.login();
```

Additionally, the schema is accessible as {@link Gateway#schema}:

```javascript
// Access to our channels gateway's schema
client.gateways.get('channels').schema;
```
