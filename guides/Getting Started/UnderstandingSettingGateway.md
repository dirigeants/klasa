# SettingGateway

The SettingGateway is designed to provide users a very useful interface for managing data. Each instance is able to handle a completely different schema and database.

By default, Klasa uses the [json](https://github.com/dirigeants/klasa/blob/master/src/providers/json.js) provider. Do not be fooled and insta-replace with SQLite, Klasa's JSON provider writes the data [atomically](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomicity_(database_systems) ), in other words, it is very rare for the data to corrupt.

## Key types

The types supported for Gateway's keys are the same as the name of the properties from the {@link SettingResolver}, by extending it, you'll also extend the available key types.

| Name             | Type                                  | Description                                                                              |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **any**          | Anything, no type restriction         | Resolves anything, even objects, the usage of this type will make a key unconfigurable   |
| **boolean**      | A boolean resolvable                  | Resolves a boolean primitive value                                                       |
| **channel**      | A {@link Channel} instance or id      | Resolves a channel. Be careful with using this, as it accepts any type of channel        |
| **command**      | A {@link Command} instance or name    | Resolves a Command                                                                       |
| **emoji**        | An {@link Emoji} instance or name     | Resolves a custom emoji                                                                  |
| **float**        | A floating point number               | Resolves a [float](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-precision_floating-point_format) |
| **guild**        | A {@link KlasaGuild} instance or id   | Resolves a KlasaGuild (which extends Guild)                                              |
| **integer**      | An integer number                     | Resolves an [integer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integer) number                      |
| **language**     | A {@link Language} instance or name   | Resolves a language                                                                      |
| **member**       | A {@link GuildMember} instance or id  | Resolves a GuildMember                                                                   |
| **msg**          | A {@link KlasaMessage} instance or id | Resolves a KlasaMessage (which extends Message)                                          |
| **role**         | A {@link Role} instance or id         | Resolves a Role                                                                          |
| **string**       | A string resolvable                   | Resolves a string                                                                        |
| **textchannel**  | A {@link TextChannel} instance or id  | Resolves a TextChannel                                                                   |
| **url**          | An URL resolvable                     | Resolves a URL with Node.js' URL parser                                                  |
| **user**         | A {@link KlasaUser} instance or id    | Resolves a KlasaUser (which extends User)                                                |

> To extend the types, you may extend {@link SettingResolver} by making an extendable, check how to make them here: {@tutorial CreatingExtendables}.

## Change the *provider's engine*.

For example, let's say I have downloaded the *rethinkdb* provider and I want to work with it, then we go to your main script file (`app.js`, `bot.js`..., wherever you declare the new Klasa.Client), and write the following code:

```javascript
const client = new Klasa.Client({ providers: { default: 'rethinkdb' } });
```

Your Klasa's configuration will look something like this:

```javascript
const client = new Klasa.Client({
	prefix: 'k!',
	providers: { default: 'rethinkdb' }
});

client.login('A_BEAUTIFUL_TOKEN_AINT_IT?');
```

And now, you're using rethinkdb's provider to store the data from SettingGateway.

What happens when I use an engine that does not exist as a provider? Simple, SettingGateway will throw an error. Should this happen, make sure you typed the provider's name correctly.

## Add new 'keys' to the guild configuration's schema.

You can easily add keys to the schema by doing this:

```javascript
this.client.gateways.guilds.schema.addKey(key, options, force);
```

Where:

- `key` is the key's name to add, `String` type.
- `options` is an object containing the options for the key, such as `type`, `default`, `sql`, `array`...
- `force` (defaults to `true`) is whether SchemaManager should update all documents/rows to match the new schema, using the `options.default` value.

For example, let's say I want to add a new configuration key, called `modlogs`, which takes a channel.

```javascript
this.client.gateways.guilds.schema.addKey('modlogs', { type: 'TextChannel' });
```

This will create a new configuration key, called `modlogs`, and will take a `TextChannel` type.

> The force parameter defaults to `true` instead of `false`. It's recommended to leave it as true to avoid certain unwanted actions.

But now, I want to add another key, with name of `users`, *so I can set a list of blacklisted users who won't be able to use commands*, which will take an array of Users.

```javascript
this.client.gateways.guilds.schema.addKey('users', { type: 'User', array: true });
```

> `options.array` defaults to `false`, and when `options.default` is not specified, it defaults to `null`, however, when `options.array` is `true`, `options.default` defaults to `[]` (empty array).

What have we done? `client.gateways.guilds.schema` is a {@link SchemaFolder} instance (also called Folder type) which can manage itself, such as adding keys/folders to itself (it certainly follows the OOP paradigm).

## Editing keys from the guild configuration.

Now that I have a new key called `modlogs`, I want to configure it outside the `conf` command, how can we do this?

```javascript
msg.guild.configs.update('modlogs', '267727088465739778', msg.guild);
```

Check: {@link Configuration#update}

> You can use a Channel instance, {@link SettingResolver} will make sure the input is valid and the database gets an **ID** and not an object.

Now, I want to **add** a new user user to the `users` key, which takes an array.

```javascript
msg.guild.configs.update('users', '146048938242211840', { action: 'add' });
```

That will add the user `'146048938242211840'` to the `users` array. To remove it:

```javascript
msg.guild.configs.update('users', '146048938242211840', { action: 'remove' });
```

> Additionally, if no 'action' option is passed to {@link Configuration.ConfigurationUpdateOptions}, it'll assume the `auto` mode, which will add or remove depending on the existence of the key.

## Removing a key from the guild configuration.

I have a key which is useless for me, so I *want* to remove it from the schema.

```javascript
this.client.gateways.guilds.schema.removeKey('users');
```

## Create a new folder in the schema

It's very similar to how you create a new key, but it only accepts three arguments:

```javascript
this.client.gateways.guilds.schema.addFolder(name, object, force);
```

So, let's say I want a key called 'modlogs' into the 'channels' folder for organization. There are two ways to do it:

### Slower

```javascript
async () => {
	const { schema } = this.client.gateways.guilds;

	await schema.addFolder('channels');
	await schema.channels.addKey('modlogs', { type: 'TextChannel' });
	console.log(schema.channels.modlogs.toJSON());
	// {
	//  	type: 'textchannel',
	//  	array: false,
	//  	default: null,
	//  	min: null,
	//  	max: null,
	//  	configurable: true
	// }
};
```

### Faster

```javascript
async () => {
	const { schema } = this.client.gateways.guilds;

	await schema.addFolder('channels', { modlogs: { type: 'TextChannel' } });
	console.log(schema.channels.modlogs.toJSON());
	// {
	//  	type: 'textchannel',
	//  	array: false,
	//  	default: null,
	//  	min: null,
	//  	max: null,
	//  	configurable: true
	// }
};
```

Now, how we do configure it with the built-in conf command? Easy:

```sh
k!conf set channels.modlogs #modlogs
```

## Add a key to the guild configuration's schema if it doesn't exist.

In [Klasa-Pieces](https://github.com/dirigeants/klasa-pieces/), specially, some pieces require a key from the configuration to work, however, the creator of the pieces does not know if the user who downloads the piece has it, so this function becomes useful in this case.

```javascript
async () => {
	const { schema } = this.client.gateways.guilds;

	if (!schema.hasKey('modlog')) {
		await schema.addKey('modlog', { type: 'TextChannel' });
	}
};
```

## How can I create new Gateway instances?

By using {@link GatewayDriver}, (available from `client.gateways`).

Let's say I want to add a new Gateway instance called `channels` that stores data to complement our permissions.
You'll want a validate function to ensure what you're inputting is a valid channel, and you would want a channel specific schema to handle our channel specific permissions, like the two below.

```javascript
// Must use the function keyword or be a method of a class.
async function validate(channelResolvable) {
	// 'this' is referred to the GatewayDriver's instance, it has access
	// to client, resolver...
	const result = await this.resolver.channel(channelResolvable);
	if (result) return result;

	throw 'The parameter <Channel> expects either a Channel ID or a Channel Instance.';
}

// Define the schema for the new Gateway.
const schema = {
	disabledCommands: {
		type: 'Command',
		default: [],
		array: true
	},
	commandThrottle: {
		type: 'Integer',
		default: 5,
		min: 0,
		max: 60
	},
	commandReset: {
		type: 'Integer',
		default: 2,
		min: 0,
		max: 30
	}
};

// Now, we create it:
this.client.gateways.add('channels', validate, schema);
```

> Since [[#43](https://github.com/dirigeants/klasa/pull/43)], validate only accepts a single argument, instead of resolver being the first one.

> The `validate` function must be a [**function**](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/function), not a [**Arrow Function**](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/Arrow_functions), the difference between them is that an arrow function binds `this` to wherever the function has been created (for example, the `exports` from your eval command, if you are doing this with eval), while the normal functions does not do this.

> If the `validate` function does not resolve **Guild** type, you might want to use the third argument of {@link Configuration#update}, which takes a Guild resolvable.

And then, you can access to it by:

```javascript
this.client.gateways.channels;
```

## Using different providers in different gateways

This is new from the SettingGateway v2 (check [#43](https://github.com/dirigeants/klasa/pull/43)), when creating a new Gateway (check above for how to do it), there's an extra parameter in `client.gateways.add` called `options`. It's optional, but it accepts an object with one key: `provider`, which is the Provider/SQLProvider (json, leveldb, rethinkdb...). For example:

```javascript
this.client.gateways.add('channels', validate, schema, { provider: 'rethinkdb' });
```

The code above will create a new Gateway instance called 'channels', which will use RethinkDB to store the persistent data.

## Customizing the options for each built-in gateway

This is available in 0.5.0 since the PR [#152](https://github.com/dirigeants/klasa/pull/152), and you're able to configure the three built-in gateways: `guilds`, `users` and `clientStorage`. The option to configure them is {@link KlasaClient.KlasaClientOptions.gateways}, where you would add the option `gateways` to your KlasaClientOptions:

```javascript
const client = new Klasa.Client({
	prefix: 'k!',
	providers: { default: 'json' },
	gateways: {
		guilds: { provider: 'rethinkdb' },
		users: { provider: 'postgresql' }
	}
});

client.login('A_BEAUTIFUL_TOKEN_AINT_IT?');
```

Where the *clientStorage* gateway would take the default options (json provider), the *guilds* gateway would use the rethinkdb provider, and finally the *users* one would use the postgresql provider. These options are {@link GatewayDriver.GatewayDriverAddOptions}.

## Modifying a SchemaPiece's parameters

Once created, it's possible since 0.5.0 to modify a {@link SchemaPiece}'s parameter, it's as simple as doing {@link SchemaPiece#update} which takes the same options for adding a key with {@link SchemaFolder#addKey} but with one exception: `array` and `type` can't change.

For example, let's say we dislike the current prefix and we want to change it to `s!` for the next entries, then you can simply do:

```javascript
this.client.gateways.guilds.schema.prefix.modify({ default: 's!' });
```

### The Type Issue

The main reason for why we don't support modifying the parameters `array` and `type` is:

> Changing the type is very complex. For example, in SQL, if we changed the type from `TEXT`, `VARCHAR`, or any other string type to a numeric one such as `INTEGER`, we could risk the database potentially throwing an error or setting them to null, which would result in data loss. We would then need to download all of the data first, and insert them back with the new type. The same thing happens in NoSQL.

Changing the value of `array` from a non-string datatype can result on the issue above, and it's a very slow process. Therefore, it's much better to just remove the key and add it back.
