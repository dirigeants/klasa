They cascade up to a permission level break, so guild owners can do everything the lower levels can do, and so on.\n\nFor instace the conf command requires level 6 to run, by default this is how it works:\n\n- level 6 requires 'MANAGE_GUILD' Permission: true/false\n- level 7 is the guild Owner: true/false\n- level 8 is not defined, and always returns false\n- level 9 is the bot owner, and has break so we will stop checking higher rules: true/false\n\nIf any check from 6-9 returns true, the user will be able to run that command. Also, if no break is encountered, the command will silently fail, instead of telling the user \"they don't have permission to use x command\"...\n\n## Understanding \"Breaking Levels\"\n\nPretend for a moment, that permission levels work like this:\n\n<!-- eslint-disable no-fallthrough -->\n\n```javascript\nfunction permissionLevel(client, msg) {\n\tswitch (level) {\n\t\tcase 0:\n\t\t\treturn true;\n\t\tcase 1:\n\t\tcase 2:\n\t\tcase 3:\n\t\tcase 4:\n\t\tcase 5:\n\t\tcase 6:\n\t\t\tif (msg.guild && msg.member.permissions.has('MANAGE_GUILD')) return true;\n\t\tcase 7:\n\t\t\tif (msg.guild && msg.member === msg.guild.owner) return true;\n\t\tcase 8:\n\t\tcase 9:\n\t\t\tif (msg.author === client.owner) return true;\n\t\t\tbreak;\n\t\tcase 10:\n\t\t\tif (msg.author === client.owner) return true;\n\t\t\treturn false;\n\t}\n\tthrow 'You don\\'t have permission';\n}\n```\n\n<!-- eslint-enable no-fallthrough -->\n\nCompletely ignoring that your check function can be async and returning false is how you progress to the next check if applicable, it works like that. It checks levels starting with the __minimum level__ acceptable for any action. (Usually a {@link Command#permLevel}) And it continues checking higher levels until it __returns true__ or hits a break. And if there is no break when levels run out, it's silent.\n\nThis does mean that you can design permission levels where guild owners, and even you the client/bot owner can't access. Say you have a breaking permission level 3 that checks if `msg.author.configs.xp >= 1000`. When a command with a permLevel of 3 is called, if you don't have that much xp, it will return you don't have permission to use that command even though you may satisfy higher levels. It breaks at that level, and won't check anything higher.\n\n## Creating Completely Custom PermissionLevels\n\nEach level consists of a number (the level), a boolean (whether the level is a break or not), and a function (the check function that returns true or false). Check: {@link PermissionLevels#addLevel}\n\nExample:\n\n```javascript\nconst { Client, PermissionLevels } = require('klasa');\nconst config = require('./config.json');\n\nconfig.permissionLevels = new PermissionLevels()\n\t/*\n\t * Optionally you can pass a number to set a custom number of permission levels.\n\t * It is not advised however, as internal commands expect 10 to be the highest permission level.\n\t * Modifying away from 10 without further modification of all core commands,\n\t * could put your server at risk of malicious users using the core eval command.\n\t */\n\t// everyone can use these commands\n\t.addLevel(0, false, () => true)\n\t// Members of guilds must have 'MANAGE_GUILD' permission\n\t.addLevel(6, false, (client, msg) => msg.guild && msg.member.permissions.has('MANAGE_GUILD'))\n\t// The member using this command must be the guild owner\n\t.addLevel(7, false, (client, msg) => msg.guild && msg.member === msg.guild.owner)\n\t/*\n\t * Allows the Bot Owner to use any lower commands\n\t * and causes any command with a permission level 9 or lower to return an error if no check passes.\n\t */\n\t.addLevel(9, true, (client, msg) => msg.author === client.owner)\n\t// Allows the bot owner to use Bot Owner only commands, which silently fail for other users.\n\t.addLevel(10, false, (client, msg) => msg.author === client.owner);\n\nnew Client(config).login(config.token);\n```\n\n## Customizing the default PermissionLevels\n\nAnother way you can customize permission levels is simply modifying the defaultPermissionLevels:\n\nExample:\n\n```javascript\nconst { Client } = require('klasa');\nconst config = require('./config.json');\n\nClient.defaultPermissionLevels\n\t// let some group of people who solved some easteregg clues use a special command/some custom non-admin role\n\t.addLevel(3, false, (client, msg) => msg.guild.configs.solvers.includes(msg.author.id))\n\t// Make the requirements to use the conf command stricter than just who can add the bot to the guild\n\t.addLevel(6, false, (client, msg) => msg.guild && msg.member.permissions.has('ADMINISTRATOR'))\n\t// add a role above guild owners that let your support team help setup/troubleshoot on other guilds.\n\t.addLevel(8, false, (client, msg) => client.configs.botSupportTeam.includes(msg.author.id));\n\nnew Client(config).login(config.token);\n```\n\n## What's different from Komada?\n\nPermission levels are fairly close to the same as Komada Permission levels, with a few exceptions.\n\n### The default permission level structure is different: {@link KlasaClient.defaultPermissionLevels}\n\n| Level | Break | Description                                           |\n| ----- | ----- | ----------------------------------------------------- |\n| 0     | false | Everyone can use these commands                       |\n| 6     | false | Members of guilds must have 'MANAGE_GUILD' permission |\n| 7     | false | Guild Owner                                           |\n| 9     | true  | Bot Owner                                             |\n| 10    | false | Bot Owner (silent)                                    |\n\n>This gives the bot creator a cleaner slate to work with when first creating a bot. (Not all bots are mod bots, so mod/admin roles were largly unneed. Also there is infinitely more that you would want to put between 0 and administrative users, than between Guild Owner and Bot Owner). This helps keep bot creators from having to completely \"remake the wheel\" of permissions in almost all cases, without preventing that if wanted. (This fixes most cases of those who perpetually had to transfer/modify core commands to match their custom permissionLevels.)\n\n### Since inhibitors are async in Klasa, check functions may be async\n\nSo you can have:\n\n```javascript\nClient.defaultPermissionLevels\n\t.addLevel(3, false, async (client, msg) => {\n\t\tconst value = await someAsyncFunction();\n\t\treturn value === someOtherValue;\n\t});\n```\n","path":"guides/Getting Started/UnderstandingPermissionLevels.md"},"UnderstandingSettingGateway":{"name":"Understanding SettingGateway","type":"md","content":"# SettingGateway\n\nThe SettingGateway is designed to provide users a very useful interface for managing data. Each instance is able to handle a completely different schema and database.\n\nBy default, Klasa uses the [json](https://github.com/dirigeants/klasa/blob/master/src/providers/json.js) provider. Do not be fooled and insta-replace with SQLite, Klasa's JSON provider writes the data [atomically](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomicity_(database_systems) ), in other words, it is very rare for the data to corrupt.\n\n## Key types\n\nThe types supported for Gateway's keys are the same as the name of the properties from the {@link SettingResolver}, by extending it, you'll also extend the available key types.\n\n| Name             | Type                                  | Description                                                                              |\n| ---------------- | ------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| **any**          | Anything, no type restriction         | Resolves anything, even objects, the usage of this type will make a key unconfigurable   |\n| **boolean**      | A boolean resolvable                  | Resolves a boolean primitive value                                                       |\n| **channel**      | A {@link Channel} instance or id      | Resolves a channel.

Simple, SettingGateway will throw an error. Should this happen, make sure you typed the provider's name correctly.\n\n## Add new 'keys' to the guild configuration's schema.\n\nYou can easily add keys to the schema by doing this:\n\n```javascript\nthis.client.gateways.guilds.schema.addKey(key, options, force);\n```\n\nWhere:\n\n- `key` is the key's name to add, `String` type.\n- `options` is an object containing the options for the key, such as `type`, `default`, `sql`, `array`...\n- `force` (defaults to `true`) is whether SchemaManager should update all documents/rows to match the new schema, using the `options.default` value.\n\nFor example, let's say I want to add a new configuration key, called `modlogs`, which takes a channel.\n\n```javascript\nthis.client.gateways.guilds.schema.addKey('modlogs', { type: 'TextChannel' });\n```\n\nThis will create a new configuration key, called `modlogs`, and will take a `TextChannel` type.\n\n> The force parameter defaults to `true` instead of `false`. It's recommended to leave it as true to avoid certain unwanted actions.\n\nBut now, I want to add another key, with name of `users`, *so I can set a list of blacklisted users who won't be able to use commands*, which will take an array of Users.\n\n```javascript\nthis.client.gateways.guilds.schema.addKey('users', { type: 'User', array: true });\n```\n\n> `options.array` defaults to `false`, and when `options.default` is not specified, it defaults to `null`, however, when `options.array` is `true`, `options.default` defaults to `[]` (empty array).\n\nWhat have we done? `client.gateways.guilds.schema` is a {@link SchemaFolder} instance (also called Folder type) which can manage itself, such as adding keys/folders to itself (it certainly follows the OOP paradigm).\n\n## Editing keys from the guild configuration.\n\nNow that I have a new key called `modlogs`, I want to configure it outside the `conf` command, how can we do this?\n\n```javascript\nmsg.guild.configs.update('modlogs', '267727088465739778', msg.guild);\n```\n\nCheck: {@link Configuration#update}\n\n> You can use a Channel instance, {@link SettingResolver} will make sure the input is valid and the database gets an **ID** and not an object.\n\nNow, I want to **add** a new user user to the `users` key, which takes an array.\n\n```javascript\nmsg.guild.configs.update('users', '146048938242211840', { action: 'add' });\n```\n\nThat will add the user `'146048938242211840'` to the `users` array. To remove it:\n\n```javascript\nmsg.guild.configs.update('users', '146048938242211840', { action: 'remove' });\n```\n\n> Additionally, if no 'action' option is passed to {@link Configuration.ConfigurationUpdateOptions}, it'll assume the `auto` mode, which will add or remove depending on the existence of the key.\n\n## Removing a key from the guild configuration.\n\nI have a key which is useless for me, so I *want* to remove it from the schema.\n\n```javascript\nthis.client.gateways.guilds.schema.removeKey('users');\n```\n\n## Create a new folder in the schema\n\nIt's very similar to how you create a new key, but it only accepts three arguments:\n\n```javascript\nthis.client.gateways.guilds.schema.addFolder(name, object, force);\n```\n\nSo, let's say I want a key called 'modlogs' into the 'channels' folder for organization. There are two ways to do it:\n\n### Slower\n\n```javascript\nasync () => {\n\tconst { schema } = this.client.gateways.guilds;\n\n\tawait schema.addFolder('channels');\n\tawait schema.channels.addKey('modlogs', { type: 'TextChannel' });\n\tconsole.log(schema.channels.modlogs.toJSON());\n\t// {\n\t//  \ttype: 'textchannel',\n\t//  \tarray: false,\n\t//  \tdefault: null,\n\t//  \tmin: null,\n\t//  \tmax: null,\n\t//  \tconfigurable: true\n\t// }\n};\n```\n\n### Faster\n\n```javascript\nasync () => {\n\tconst { schema } = this.client.gateways.guilds;\n\n\tawait schema.addFolder('channels', { modlogs: { type: 'TextChannel' } });\n\tconsole.log(schema.channels.modlogs.toJSON());\n\t// {\n\t//  \ttype: 'textchannel',\n\t//  \tarray: false,\n\t//  \tdefault: null,\n\t//  \tmin: null,\n\t//  \tmax: null,\n\t//  \tconfigurable: true\n\t// }\n};\n```\n\nNow, how we do configure it with the built-in conf command? Easy:\n\n```sh\nk!conf set channels.modlogs #modlogs\n```\n\n## Add a key to the guild configuration's schema if it doesn't exist.\n\nIn [Klasa-Pieces](https://github.com/dirigeants/klasa-pieces/), specially, some pieces require a key from the configuration to work, however, the creator of the pieces does not know if the user who downloads the piece has it, so this function becomes useful in this case.\n\n```javascript\nasync () => {\n\tconst { schema } = this.client.gateways.guilds;\n\n\tif (!schema.hasKey('modlog')) {\n\t\tawait schema.addKey('modlog', { type: 'TextChannel' });\n\t}\n};\n```\n\n## How can I create new Gateway instances?\n\nBy using {@link GatewayDriver}, (available from `client.gateways`).\n\nLet's say I want to add a new Gateway instance called `channels` that stores data to complement our permissions.\nYou'll want a validate function to ensure what you're inputting is a valid channel, and you would want a channel specific schema to handle our channel specific permissions, like the two below.\n\n```javascript\n// Must use the function keyword or be a method of a class.\nasync function validate(channelResolvable) {\n\t// 'this' is referred to the GatewayDriver's instance, it has access\n\t// to client, resolver...\n\tconst result = await this.resolver.channel(channelResolvable);\n\tif (result) return result;\n\n\tthrow 'The parameter <Channel> expects either a Channel ID or a Channel Instance.';\n}\n\n// Define the schema for the new Gateway.\nconst schema = {\n\tdisabledCommands: {\n\t\ttype: 'Command',\n\t\tdefault: [],\n\t\tarray: true\n\t},\n\tcommandThrottle: {\n\t\ttype: 'Integer',\n\t\tdefault: 5,\n\t\tmin: 0,\n\t\tmax: 60\n\t},\n\tcommandReset: {\n\t\ttype: 'Integer',\n\t\tdefault: 2,\n\t\tmin: 0,\n\t\tmax: 30\n\t}\n};\n\n// Now, we create it:\nthis.client.gateways.add('channels', validate, schema);\n```\n\n> Since [[#43](https://github.com/dirigeants/klasa/pull/43)], validate only accepts a single argument, instead of resolver being the first one.\n\n> The `validate` function must be a [**function**](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/function), not a [**Arrow Function**](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/Arrow_functions), the difference between them is that an arrow function binds `this` to wherever the function has been created (for example, the `exports` from your eval command, if you are doing this with eval), while the normal functions does not do this.\n\n> If the `validate` function does not resolve **Guild** type, you might want to use the third argument of {@link Configuration#update}, which takes a Guild resolvable.\n\nAnd then, you can access to it by:\n\n```javascript\nthis.client.gateways.channels;\n```\n\n## Using different providers in different gateways\n\nThis is new from the SettingGateway v2 (check [#43](https://github.com/dirigeants/klasa/pull/43)), when creating a new Gateway (check above for how to do it), there's an extra parameter in `client.gateways.add` called `options`. It's optional, but it accepts an object with one key: `provider`, which is the Provider/SQLProvider (json, leveldb, rethinkdb...). For example:\n\n```javascript\nthis.client.gateways.add('channels', validate, schema, { provider: 'rethinkdb' });\n```\n\nThe code above will create a new Gateway instance called 'channels', which will use RethinkDB to store the persistent data.\n\n## Customizing the options for each built-in gateway\n\nThis is available in 0.5.0 since the PR [#152](https://github.com/dirigeants/klasa/pull/152), and you're able to configure the three built-in gateways: `guilds`, `users` and `clientStorage`. The option to configure them is {@link KlasaClient.KlasaClientOptions.gateways}, where you would add the option `gateways` to your KlasaClientOptions:\n\n```javascript\nconst client = new Klasa.Client({\n\tprefix: 'k!',\n\tproviders: { default: 'json' },\n\tgateways: {\n\t\tguilds: { provider: 'rethinkdb' },\n\t\tusers: { provider: 'postgresql' }\n\t}\n});\n\nclient.login('A_BEAUTIFUL_TOKEN_AINT_IT?');\n```\n\nWhere the *clientStorage* gateway would take the default options (json provider), the *guilds* gateway would use the rethinkdb provider, and finally the *users* one would use the postgresql provider. These options are {@link GatewayDriver.GatewayDriverAddOptions}.\n\n## Modifying a SchemaPiece's parameters\n\nOnce created, it's possible since 0.5.0 to modify a {@link SchemaPiece}'s parameter, it's as simple as doing {@link SchemaPiece#update} which takes the same options for adding a key with {@link SchemaFolder#addKey} but with one exception: `array` and `type` can't change.\n\nFor example, let's say we dislike the current prefix and we want to change it to `s!` for the next entries, then you can simply do:\n\n```javascript\nthis.client.gateways.guilds.schema.prefix.modify({ default: 's!' });\n```\n\n### The Type Issue\n\nThe main reason for why we don't support modifying the parameters `array` and `type` is:\n\n> Changing the type is very complex. For example, in SQL, if we changed the type from `TEXT`, `VARCHAR`, or any other string type to a numeric one such as `INTEGER`, we could risk the database potentially throwing an error or setting them to null, which would result in data loss. We would then need to download all of the data first, and insert them back with the new type. The same thing happens in NoSQL.\n\nChanging the value of `array` from a non-string datatype can result on the issue above, and it's a very slow process. Therefore, it's much better to just remove the key and add it back.\n","path":"guides/Getting Started/UnderstandingSettingGateway.md"},"UnderstandingUsageStrings":{"name":"Understanding Usage Strings","type":"md","content":"## Usage Structure\n\n`<>` required argument, `[]` optional argument `<Name:Type{Min,Max}/Regex/Flags>`\n\n- **Name** Mostly used for debugging message, unless the type is Literal in which it compares the argument to the name.\n- **Type** The type of variable you are expecting.\n- **Min, Max** Minimum or Maximum for a giving variable (works on strings in terms of length, and on all types of numbers in terms of value) You are allowed to define any combination of min and max. Omit for none, `{min}` for min, `{,max}` for max. If you set `min` and `max` with the same integer, then the provided string must have equal length.\n- **Regex, Flags** A regular expression with double escaped `\\` to match against the argument. It is only valid for regex types of arguments, but gives you great flexibility on custom argument parsing. Flags are regex flags to apply to the regex pattern.\n- **Special Repeat Tag** `[...]` will repeat the last usage optionally until you run out of arguments. Useful for doing something like `<SearchTerm:str> [...]` which will allow you to take as many search terms as you want, per your Usage Delimiter.\n\n> Note: You can set multiple options in an argument by writting `|`.

configurate the command, we'll start writting it:\n\n```javascript\nmodule.exports = class extends Command {\n\n\tasync run(msg, [...params]) {\n\t\t// This is where you place the code you want to run when your command is called\n\t}\n\n};\n```\n\n`[...params]` represents a variable number of parameters given when the command is run. The name of the parameters in the array (and their count) is determined by the `usage` property and its given arguments.\n\n> Note that the commands' parameters are an array. This is a trick called [Destructuring assignment](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Destructuring_assignment).\n\nFor example, when you have: `\"<Message:msg> <delete|edit> [newContent:string]\"` as your usage, and `\"|\"` as your usageDelim, then the following code block is an example of how it would look like, and how we would work with them.\n\n```javascript\nmodule.exports = class extends Command {\n\n\tasync run(msg, [message, action, newContent]) {\n\t\t// code\n\t}\n\n};\n```\n\nIn which `message` is the argument assigned to the message object as provided in `<Message:msg>` argument from usage. Same does `action` for `<delete|edit>` and respectively.\n\n> Keep in mind that we declared `newContent` as an optional argument, if it's not provided, it'll return undefined.\n\nKeep in mind that arguments are delimited by the character or combination of characters written in *usageDelim*. In this case, we have assigned the character `|` for it. How do we use this command? Easy:\n\n`+messager 293107496191655936|delete`\n\nThe line above will execute the command with the name `messager` (or a command with `messager` as an alias), it'll use [Channel.messages.fetch](https://discord.js.org/#/docs/main/master/class/MessageStore?scrollTo=fetch). If the message is not found (you mistyped it or the message is in another channel) it'll warn you that the message hasn't been found. The next argument is a literal, in which must be either `delete` or `edit`.\n\n# Using regex arguments in your command.\n\nRegex arguments give you even more flexibility to define custom matching. Regex in usage needs to be double escaped like the following: `<hexColor:regex/#?([\\\\da-f]{6})/i>`. That regex will resolve into: `/#?([\\da-f]{6})/i` which should match any hexcolor string. When you use a regex argument, the result of [RegExp.prototype.exec](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/RegExp/exec) will be passed into the command.\n\nSo we can do the following destructuring to get the first matching group of the hexColor arg:\n\n```javascript\nmodule.exports = class extends Command {\n\n\tasync run(msg, [[, hexColor]]) {\n\t\t// code\n\t}\n\n};\n```\n\nSo the command `+getrgb #ab24ff` would make hexColor: 'ab24ff'.\n","path":"guides/Getting Started/UnderstandingUsageStrings.md"},"UnderstandingCustomArguments":{"name":"Understanding Custom Arguments","type":"md","content":"One of the best features from Klasa's (and Komada's) usage is that you can extend its functionality by adding new types. To achieve this, we will use our {@link Extendable}s. We will create an empty extendable, called `emoji.js`, and aim it to Klasa:\n\n> **Note**: The following argument type type is already included in klasa, and is just an explanation of how it works.\n\n```javascript\nconst { Extendable } = require('klasa');\n\nmodule.exports = class extends Extendable {\n\n\tconstructor(...args) {\n\t\tsuper(...args, ['ArgResolver'], { klasa: true });\n\t}\n\n\textend() {\n\t\t// `this` refers to the parent class, and not this one.

Let's consider arg is `<:klasa:354702113147846666>`. The result of `exec`uting `REGEX_EMOJI` on that string gives an array-like object: `['<:klasa:354702113147846666>', '354702113147846666', index: 0, input: '<:klasa:354702113147846666>']`.\n1. There are cases the argument does not match, in that case, `results` would be `null`. So we verify its existence and get the first grouping match: `(\\d{17,19})`, which gets the **id** of the emoji, and as we see in the result, it is in the second index: `'354702113147846666'`, and we get the emoji with said id.\n1. If `results` was null, `emoji` would be `null` too due to the ternary condition, but there is also the possibility of emoji being undefined: when the client does not have the Emoji instance cached or is in a guild the bot is not in. The case is, **if the emoji is valid and found, we should return it**.\n1. If the emoji was valid and found, we do not run the two next steps, 4 and 5. The fourth line of code inside `extend` handles optional arguments: if it's optional and it's not a repeating tag, it should not throw, but return null.\n1. Finally, the argument was required and/or looping/repeating, so we should throw an error. That error must be a string and you can use i18n to have localized errors.\n\nAnd now, you can use this type in a command!

Unlike many other frameworks, Klasa and Komada use a system called **usage string** to improve simplicity, in the next three pages, you will learn how to use it correctly.\n\n## Command Arguments\n\nWhat are command arguments and how do they differ from parameters? Arguments are raw strings based on the input by the user split based on {@link Command#usageDelim} or {@link Command#quotedStringSupport}. A resolver converts the arguments to parameters based on the possible usage type.\n\nFor example, let's say you want a command to take a user and a channel, then you just put a string to usage being: `'<selectedUser:user> <selectedChannel:channel>'`, that tells the __internal parser__ to take and parse them, if both validate correctly in the command output (i.e. `[p]command @user #channel`), the internal parser will pass an instance of {@link KlasaUser} and {@link external:Channel} inside an array, being **parameters**.\n\nIn short, usage is what defines the input that the command and internal parser should take, message arguments ({@link KlasaMessage#args}) are the raw arguments (array of string), and message parameters ({@link KlasaMessage#params}) are an array with the parsed arguments.\n\n## Structure\n\nThe command usage is an option for {@link CommandOptions.usage} and **requires** a {@link CommandOptions.usageDelim} string when there are multiple arguments. Why? Because if there's no usageDelim, `undefined` is implied, and [String#split](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/split) doesn't split the string but converts it to a __single value array__ (message arguments), you definitively don't want this behaviour when you have two command arguments because it'll require at least two message arguments.\n\nThe structure is rather simple, {@link CommandOptions.usage} is always a string and not an object, and is inspired by the [CLI format standard](http://docopt.org/), inheriting the meaning for the tokens `<>` (required arguments), `[]` (optional elements), `|` (mutually exclusive or multiple choice) and `...` (repeating arguments), but adds more elements.\n\nArguments can **only** have one requirement level and cannot be into another, neither can they have spaces inside. That is, everything must be enclosed by `<` with `>`, `[` with `]` or `(` with `)`. They have different meanings.\n\n- The first one (`<>`) defines **required** arguments, the command will not run until these arguments are processed correctly, they can be anywhere.\n- The second one (`[]`) defines **optional** arguments, they're ignored when the input is incorrect and said message argument may drift to the next. That is, if you have an optional argument taking `1` and the next argument is `2` (both literals) and you pass `2`, the first parameter will be ignored while the second will take it (do not confuse with arguments).\n- The latter (`()`) defines **semi-required** arguments, they are an hybrid between both and they can turn into required arguments when a value is the argument resolver dictates they are required (resolves to undefined if not required).\n\n> Semi-required arguments are implemented in Klasa since 0.5.0, check PR [here](https://github.com/dirigeants/klasa/pull/162).\n\nBut in difference to the CLI command format standard, we have **our own standard**, and we implement more things such the aforementioned **semi-required** arguments, and more.\n\nA more in-depth vision of arguments is that they are *arrays* of \"possibles\", that is, even if we aren't using the `|` token which defines extra types/possibles, there's always one for each argument. So `<nameOne:typeOne|nameTwo:typeTwo>` is an argument with **two possibles**. Each possible has their own structure and options:\n\n- They are grouped into a \"Tag\" or \"argument\", a Tag is a parsed argument that contains these multiple possibles, therefore, possibles inherit the required level from them. For example, if a Tag is required and has 3 possibles, the __internal parser__ will try to parse all three until it finds one that resolves, in the opposite case (no match), it'll ask for one of them.\n- They have their own names, types, and options. You can have a Tag with multiple types, for example, `<target:member|userID:string>` is a Tag with two possibles, one that will try to resolve into a `GuildMember` instance, or a `string` if it did not match (be careful as the `string` type is \"lazy\": it always resolve, so they should put last).\n\n## Repeating arguments\n\nUnlike in CLI, repeating arguments are **only** written as `[...]` and goes at the end of usage, making the last argument repeating. What does this mean? Let's say you want to have a [**choice**](https://github.com/dirigeants/klasa-pieces/blob/master/commands/Fun/choice.js) command, then you may want the user to write in multiple arguments, more likely with `,` as **usageDelim** to separate them. They you may put `<choice:string> [...]`, which makes the command take one or more parameters of this type.\n\nUnlike normal arguments, a repeating one can resolve into one or more parameters, all of the same type (or of the first one that resolves if using multiple possibles), that being said, it's advisable to use the [spread syntax](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Spread_operator) for arrays if you have multiple arguments.\n\n> **Note**: A common mistake is to use `[...choices]` in the `Command#run`, as you may know, `[...choices]` is identical to `choices` by the simple fact you're creating an array with all the elements of choices, or said in another way: an identical array. You can check it in the MDN link for spread syntax.\n\n## Possible Structure\n\nAs mentioned before, a `Tag` is a **parsed argument tag** (`<>`, `()` or `[]`) that contains an array of **multiple Possible**s. But what is their format? Generally, they're written as `name:type`, where `name` is the name of the argument, and `type` is the type. However, depending on the type you can use the options or not.\n\n- **name** is the name of the argument, they're used to identify an argument by giving it a name, a good name should be self explanatory and easy to read for the end user.\n- **type** is the name of the type, they're not arbitrary but depends on the methods {@link ArgResolver} has. By default, there are many of them, such as `string`, `integer`, `msg`, `user`, `member`. You can also extend ArgResolver to implement extra methods, check this tutorial: {@tutorial CreatingCustomArguments}, however, if no type is given, the parser will assume them as **literal**.\n- **options** always have the format `{min,max}`, taking two integers, both optional (you can specify `{,max}` for an argument with no minimum, or `{min}` for an argument with a minimum but not a maximum), and they're used mostly in the `string`, `number` (float) and `integer`, being the string length and the number the variables to handle, respectively.\n\n## Examples\n\n- We want a required argument that takes a user, and an optional argument for a role: `<targetUser:user> [targetRole:role]`.\n- We want to accept `set`, `add`, `remove` or `reset` as required argument: `<set|add|remove|reset>`. (Remember that if no type is given, Usage will imply they are literals).\n- We want to get a GuildMember instance, or its user ID if the user is not in the guild: `<targetMember:member|userID:string{17,18}>`. (Either a GuildMember resolvable or a string with a length of 17-18, which matches with a Discord snowflake's length).\n\n## The Usage Analogy\n\nLet's make everything basic:\n\n- usage -> **blueprints**.\n- arguments -> **wood**.\n- resolvers -> **contractors**.\n- parameters -> **houses**.\n\nFirst, you write your blueprints for your houses, later, you receive wood from the woodcutters. The contractors will receive that wood and will try to build the houses with them based on the blueprints.\n\nIf the contractors work in a union, they pass on the wood to the next contractor until they can either build a house, or complain that nobody can. However, if the contractors says it's cool to not build a house here, they pass the wood on to the next place.\n\nCredits to [@bdistin](https://github.com/bdistin) for this analogy.\n\n## Further Reading:\n\n- {@tutorial CommandsSubcommands}\n- {@tutorial CommandsCustomResponses}\n- {@tutorial CommandsCustomResolvers}\n","path":"guides/Advanced Commands/CommandsArguments.md"},"CommandsSubcommands":{"name":"Commands II: Subcommands","type":"md","content":"> This feature is implemented in Klasa **0.5.0**, check the PR that implemented it [here](https://github.com/dirigeants/klasa/pull/162).\n\nIt is called **subcommand** to the special behaviour when a command takes multiple **Possible**s of literals as the first parameter, and the command has {@link CommandOptions.subcommands} set to true. An example is the [built-in conf](https://github.com/dirigeants/klasa/blob/master/src/commands/Admin/conf.js) command, which unlike any other command, it does not have a `Command#run` method.\n\nHow do subcommands work? The concept may be quite hard to *get* but it's very powerful. We will take the conf command as an example:\n\n```javascript\nconst { Command } = require('klasa');\n\nmodule.exports = class extends Command {\n\n\tconstructor(...args) {\n\t\tsuper(...args, {\n\t\t\tsubcommands: true,\n\t\t\tusage: '<get|set|remove|reset|list> (key:key) (value:value) [...]',\n\t\t\tusageDelim: ' '\n\t\t});\n\t}\n\n\tasync get(msg, params) {}\n\tasync set(msg, params) {}\n\tasync remove(msg, params) {}\n\tasync reset(msg, params) {}\n\tasync list(msg, params) {}\n\n};\n```\n\nAs you may notice it, the command does not have a `Command#run` method, but it has one method for each literal that is taken as first parameter, all of them lowercased. That is, to simplify the following pattern used in many commands:\n\n```javascript\nmodule.exports = class extends Command {\n\n\tconstructor(...args) {\n\t\tsuper(...args, {\n\t\t\tusage: '<get|set|remove|reset|list> (key:key) (value:value) [...]',\n\t\t\tusageDelim: ' '\n\t\t});\n\t}\n\n\trun(msg, [type, ...params]) {\n\t\treturn this[type](msg, params);\n\t}\n\n\tasync get(msg, params) {}\n\tasync set(msg, params) {}\n\tasync remove(msg, params) {}\n\tasync reset(msg, params) {}\n\tasync list(msg, params) {}\n\n};\n```\n\nBoth commands are equal, one key difference is that with the subcommands feature you omit the **run** method and Klasa does not call it anymore, saving you from using a \"dynamic\" usage based on the first (which is problematic for [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) users), and also saves time whilst the command keeps being simple and readable.\n\n## The TypeScript issue\n\nDynamic object assessment has been an issue for TypeScript, you can use them in dynamic objects (object literals, for example) because they imply an explicit `{ [K: string]: V }` by default, and to do so, they *may* have more objects until the object is strongly typed (without dynamic keys). In fact, most objects in JavaScript are dynamic, you can add or remove properties to and from them (hence dynamic), but there are several exceptions, [`Object.seal()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/seal) and [`Object.freeze()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/freeze) (which implies a seal) \"seal\" the parameters for the object, making its parameters not longer editable (in the case of freeze, you cannot edit any property, they become readonly).\n\nHowever, classes primitives are also \"readonly-like\" for the TypeScript compiler, there's no explicit `{ [K: string]: V }` implied, therefore, `this[key]` fails. To counter this issue, some users had to do a workaround using a [switch-case](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/switch) and hardcode the object accessment.\n\nThanks to this feature, they're not longer required to use this hacky behaviour, so they have less hardcoded, and much cleaner code. *(This feature had this issue solved as a side-effect, it was not even intended)*.\n\n## Further learning:\n\n- {@tutorial CommandsArguments}\n- {@tutorial CommandsCustomResponses}\n- {@tutorial CommandsCustomResolvers}\n","path":"guides/Advanced Commands/CommandsSubcommands.md"},"CommandsCustomResponses":{"name":"Commands III: Per-Command and per-parameter custom responses","type":"md","content":"> This feature is implemented in Klasa **0.5.0**, check the PR that implemented it [here](https://github.com/dirigeants/klasa/pull/162).\n\n## Custom Responses\n\nThis is one of the most requested features for Klasa: the ability to translate and/or customize the error messages when a parameter is missing. This is now achievable thanks to {@link Command.customizeResponse}, which takes the name of the key of the possible (remember the {@tutorial CommandsArguments} tutorial) and either a `string` or a `function` that takes one parameter: `msg` being a `KlasaMessage` instance, that you can use to get the Language instance from (check {@link KlasaMessage.language}).\n\n## Configuring/Creating a custom response\n\nThey require an argument name from the `usageString`, as you have seen in {@tutorial CommandsArguments}, the `name` is what identifies a Tag/argument, to do so, you put that name, and Klasa will modify the Tag so when it's value is not providen or is incorrect, use your custom message. Let's say we have an Overwatch command and you want Klasa to reply with a *nicer* response, for example, when you have the [RegExp](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/RegExp) type with `/(\\w{3,12})#(\\d{4,5})/i` and you want to notify the user that they did not write the name correctly, then you may want to customize the message that the framework sends so they can understand what's going wrong better. Consider the following command example:\n\n```javascript\nconst { Command } = require('klasa');\n\nmodule.exports = class extends Command {\n\n\tconstructor(...args) {\n\t\tsuper(...args, {\n\t\t\tdescription: 'Check your Overwatch stats.',\n\t\t\tusage: '<battletag:reg/(\\\\w{3,12})#(\\\\d{4,5})/i>'\n\t\t});\n\t}\n\n\tasync run(msg, [battletag]) {}\n\n};\n```\n\nAnd you want it to send 'You must insert a valid battletag with the format username#0000' when the user doesn't input a string matching the RegExp, then you may use the method {@link Command.customizeResponse} inside the commands' constructor:\n\n```javascript\nconst { Command } = require('klasa');\n\nmodule.exports = class extends Command {\n\n\tconstructor(...args) {\n\t\tsuper(...args, {\n\t\t\tdescription: 'Check your Overwatch stats.',\n\t\t\tusage: '<battletag:reg/(\\\\w{3,12})#(\\\\d{4,5})/i>'\n\t\t});\n\n\t\tthis.customizeResponse('battletag',\n\t\t\t'You must insert a valid battletag with the format username#0000');\n\t}\n\n\tasync run(msg, [battletag]) {}\n\n};\n```\n\nAnd when you miss that argument or you input something that doesn't match the RegExp pattern (triggering the required arguments' error message), it'll send the string you used instead of `'battletag is a required parameter.'`.\n\nFor multilanguage purposes, you can also pass a function with the parameters msg ({@link KlasaMessage}) and possible ({@link Possible}), and if you have a `COMMAND_INVALID_BATTLETAG` key in your language files, you can do:\n\n```javascript\nthis.customizeResponse('battletag', msg =>\n\tmsg.language.get('COMMAND_INVALID_BATTLETAG'));\n```\n\nIn a side note, `Command#customizeResponse` returns the command instance, meaning that you can chain it, for example:\n\n```javascript\nthis.customizeResponse('arg1', 'Response for argument 1')\n\t.customizeResponse('arg2', 'Response for argument 2')\n\t.customizeResponse('arg3', 'Response for argument 3')\n\t.customizeResponse('arg4', 'Response for argument 4');\n```\n\n> **Note**: If an argument already has a custom response, you cannot re-set it.\n\n## FAQ\n\n- How can I customize the response for a type with unions? Like `<add|set|delete|list>`? You can use one of the possible names, for example, `'set'`.\n- What happens if I have two arguments with the same name? Klasa will assign the custom response to the first argument that matches. A second call with that method with the same name would set it for the second.\n\n## Further Reading:\n\n- {@tutorial CommandsArguments}\n- {@tutorial CommandsCustomResolvers}\n- {@tutorial CommandsSubcommands}\n","path":"guides/Advanced Commands/CommandsCustomResponses.md"},"CommandsCustomResolvers":{"name":"Commands IV: Per-Command custom argument resolvers","type":"md","content":"> This feature is implemented in Klasa **0.5.0**, check the PR that implemented it [here](https://github.com/dirigeants/klasa/pull/162).\n\n## Custom Resolvers\n\nCustom resolvers allow developers to set up custom types for each command, they are highly customizable and can hold its own logic and type name. This is possible thanks to the {@link Command.createCustomResolver} method.\n\n## Creating a custom Command Resolver\n\nA custom resolver is usually created in the command constructor and its usage is identical to {@link ArgResolver} methods:\n\n```javascript\nthis.createCustomResolver('key', (arg, possible, msg, params) => {\n\t// Logic\n});\n```\n\nWhere the first parameter is the name of the custom type, and the second is a function that takes `arg` (string), `possible` ({@link Possible}), `msg` ({@link KlasaMessage}) and optionally, `params` (any[], remember parameters are parsed arguments).\n\nThen in your usage, you can use the type `key`, it'll be recognized as a *local* resolver that your command is able to use.

You can also check the tutorial {@tutorial CreatingCustomArguments} for further information.\n\n## Further Reading:\n\n- {@tutorial CommandsArguments}\n- {@tutorial CommandsCustomResponses}\n- {@tutorial CommandsSubcommands}\n","path":"guides/Advanced Commands/CommandsCustomResolvers.md"}}},"Other Subjects":{"name":"Other Subjects","files":{"PieceStores":{"name":"Piece Stores","type":"md","content":"Probably one of the most advanced and powerful tools in klasa is making your own stores and pieces, to do the things you want.\n\nThe most basic store:\n\n```javascript\nconst { Store } = require('klasa');\nconst Something = require('./Something');\n\nclass SomethingStore extends Store {\n\n\tconstructor(client) {\n\t\tsuper(client, 'somethings', Something);\n\t}\n\n}\n\nmodule.exports = SomethingStore;\n```\n\nThe most basic Piece:\n\n```javascript\nconst { Piece } = require('klasa');\n\nclass Something extends Piece {\n\n\trun() {\n\t\t// Defined in extension Classes\n\t}\n\n}\n\nmodule.exports = Something;\n```\n\nNow that probably doesn't give you much idea on what that means or why. But take the following idea: You are making a music bot *gasps* and you want to give it an auto-play feature. Problem is, not everyone likes the same kind of music, so lets make a GenreStore and a Genre piece for guild owners to set the genre of music they might want to listen to automatically.\n\n```javascript\nconst { Store } = require('klasa');\nconst Something = require('./Something');\n\nclass GenreStore extends Store {\n\n\tconstructor(client) {\n\t\tsuper(client, 'genres', Something);\n\t}\n\n}\n\nmodule.exports = GenreStore;\n```\n\nTbh, not that different than a simple store. Although be sure to take a look at all of the core stores. Sometimes, like in the case of Providers, we want to run a shutdown method before we delete the collection entry. In that case we also want to overwrite the clear method, and loop over the collection doing this.delete() so that all entries are shutdown properly.\n\n```javascript\nconst { Piece, util } = require('klasa');\nconst getInfoAsync = require('util').promisify(require('ytdl-core').getInfo);\n\nclass Genre extends Piece {\n\n\t/**\n\t * @param {KlasaClient} client The Klasa Client\n\t * @param {GenreStore} store The Genre store\n\t * @param {Array} file The path from the pieces folder to the command file\n\t * @param {boolean} core If the piece is in the core directory or not\n\t * @param {Object} [options={}] Optional Genre settings\n\t */\n\tconstructor(client, store, file, core, options = {}) {\n\t\tsuper(client, store, file, core, options);\n\n\t\t// we should probably describe our auto play genres in the command,\n\t\t// we will make for guild owners to set their guild's genre setting.\n\n\t\t/**\n\t\t * The genre's description\n\t\t * @type {string}\n\t\t */\n\t\tthis.description = options.description || '';\n\n\t\t// Some example artists to include with the descriptions\n\n\t\t/**\n\t\t * Examples of artists for this genre\n\t\t * @type {string[]}\n\t\t */\n\t\tthis.examples = options.examples || [];\n\t}\n\n\t// We don't even need run for this, let's call it getNext\n\tasync getNext(player) {\n\t\t// Let's define a default behavior here\n\t\t// If we aren't playing anything yet, get a link from this.seeds\n\t\t// (which is defined in each extension piece)\n\t\tif (!player.playingURL) return this.wrapLink(this.seeds[Math.floor(Math.random() * this.seeds.length)]);\n\n\t\t// If we do have a link, lets get youtube info about that link\n\t\tconst info = await getInfoAsync(player.playingURL).catch((err) => {\n\t\t\tthis.client.emit('log', err, 'error');\n\t\t\tthrow `something happened with YouTube URL: ${player.playingURL}\\n${util.codeBlock('', err)}`;\n\t\t});\n\n\t\t// Find the first video that we haven't recenly played on our player\n\t\tconst next = info.related_videos.find(vid => vid.id && !player.recentlyPlayed.includes(this.wrapLink(vid.id)));\n\t\t// If their isn't a video, reseed a video we havn't played recently\n\t\tif (!next) {\n\t\t\tconst seed = this.seeds.find(vid => !player.recentlyPlayed.includes(this.wrapLink(vid)));\n\t\t\t// If we have played all of the seeds, start over on reseeding\n\t\t\tif (!seed) {\n\t\t\t\tplayer.recentlyPlayed = [];\n\t\t\t\treturn this.wrapLink(this.seeds[Math.floor(Math.random() * this.seeds.length)]);\n\t\t\t}\n\n\t\t\t// Else return the seed we haven't played recently\n\t\t\treturn this.wrapLink(seed);\n\t\t}\n\n\t\t// Otherwise wrap the next song\n\t\treturn this.wrapLink(next.id);\n\t}\n\n\twrapLink(id) {\n\t\treturn `https://youtu.be/${id}`;\n\t}\n\n}\n\nmodule.exports = Genre;\n```\n\nHere we see some heavy customization. Such as if you need to define special enable/disable behavior. But Genre extending Piece makes our piece very easy to actually make now:\n\n```javascript\nconst Genre = require('../Genre');\n\nmodule.exports = class extends Genre {\n\n\tconstructor(...args) {\n\t\tsuper(...args, {\n\t\t\tdescription: 'Electronic Dance Music',\n\t\t\texamples: [\n\t\t\t\t'Skrillex',\n\t\t\t\t'deadmau5',\n\t\t\t\t'The Chainsmokers'\n\t\t\t]\n\t\t});\n\t\tthis.seeds = [\n\t\t\t'QV1xUseG6Gg',\n\t\t\t'F0YYoo6oFoU',\n\t\t\t// ...\n\t\t\t'RhU9MZ98jxo'\n\t\t];\n\t}\n\n};\n```\n\nThis is great and all, but we need to register these pieces/store:\n\n```javascript\nconst { Client } = require('klasa');\nconst GenreStore = require('./GenreStore');\n\nclass MySwankyMusicBot extends Client {\n\n\tconstructor(...args) {\n\t\tsuper(...args);\n\n\t\t// Make a new GenreStore and attach it to client\n\t\tthis.genres = new GenreStore();\n\n\t\t// Register the GenreStore to be loaded, init, and available\n\t\t// to be used as an arg to be looked up in commands\n\t\tthis.registerStore(this.genres);\n\n\t\t// Registers genres themselves to be able to be used as an\n\t\t// arg to be looked up in commands,\n\t\t// for reload/enable/disable ect.\n\t\tthis.registerPiece('genre', this.genres);\n\n\t\t// Optionally we can add more aliases for the piece\n\t\tthis.registerPiece('musicgenre', this.genres);\n\t}\n\n}\n\nnew MySwankyMusicBot().login('token-goes-here');\n```\n\nThen we use it in our player class I completely made up earlier like so:\n\n```javascript\nasync () => {\n\t// Without going over setting up guild configs,\n\t// or actually writing a player class.\n\tconst nextSong = await this.client.genres.get(this.guild.configs.genre)\n\t\t.getNext(this);\n\n\t// nextSong should now be a pseudo random song based on the\n\t// genre seeds and what has recently played.\n};\n```\n","path":"guides/Other Subjects/PieceStores.md"},"RichDisplay":{"name":"Rich Display","type":"md","content":"{@link RichDisplay} allows you to create a paginated embed that users of your bot will be able to browse by using reaction-based navigation.\n\nAn extremely simple working example can achieved by this code:\n\n```javascript\nconst { Command, RichDisplay } = require('klasa');\n\nmodule.exports = class extends Command {\n\n\tconstructor(...args) {\n\t\tsuper(...args, { description: 'Test RichDisplay' });\n\t}\n\n\tasync run(msg) {\n\t\treturn new RichDisplay()\n\t\t\t.addPage(new this.client.methods.Embed().setDescription('First page'))\n\t\t\t.addPage(new this.client.methods.Embed().setDescription('Second page'))\n\t\t\t.run(await msg.sendMessage('Loading...'));\n\t}\n\n};\n```\n\nA more complex example with an actual usage is this:\n\n```javascript\nconst images = [\n\t'https://i.imgur.com/gh3vYgj.jpg',\n\t'https://i.imgur.com/vBV81m4.jpg',\n\t'https://i.imgur.com/92hAsqe.jpg'\n];\n\nmodule.exports = class extends Command {\n\n\tasync run(msg) {\n\t\tconst display = new RichDisplay(new this.client.methods.Embed()\n\t\t\t.setColor(0x673AB7)\n\t\t\t.setAuthor(this.client.user.name, this.client.user.avatarURL())\n\t\t\t.setTitle('Norway Pictures Slideshow')\n\t\t\t.setDescription('Scroll between the images using the provided reaction emotes.')\n\t\t);\n\n\t\tfor (let i = 0; i < images.length; i++) {\n\t\t\tdisplay.addPage(template => template.setImage(images[i]));\n\t\t}\n\n\t\treturn display.run(await msg.sendMessage('Loading slideshow...'));\n\t}\n\n};\n```\n\n> The code is contained in the block of the aforementioned command, inside the `async run(msg)` method but the display or its pages can easily be reused by placing its initialization in the command's constructor method.\n\n## Code Analysis\n\nFirst we create a new {@link RichDisplay} instance, but this time we pass in a [`MessageEmbed`](https://discord.js.org/#/docs/main/master/class/MessageEmbed) instance, which will represent our template, from which we will be able to extend upon to create our pages later on:\n\n```javascript\nconst display = new RichDisplay(new this.client.methods.Embed()\n\t/* ... */\n);\n```\n\nThis [`MessageEmbed`](https://discord.js.org/#/docs/main/master/class/MessageEmbed) instance will be accessible to us by either calling the {@link RichDisplay.template} property of the {@link RichDisplay} instance, in a cloned manner, or directly through the {@link RichDisplay.addPage} method, if we pass in an arrow function or a callback.\n\n```javascript\nfor (const image of images) {\n\tdisplay.addPage(template => template.setImage(image));\n}\n```\n\nFrom here we will be able to add content or edit properties of the template, and then, return the final embed to the {@link RichDisplay.addPage} method to be processed into a {@link RichDisplay} page.\nIn our example, we will simply add a static image from the array we defined before.\n\n```javascript\ndisplay.addPage(template => {\n\ttemplate\n\t\t.setImage(image)\n\t\t.setColor(0xF44336);\n\t// You can change everything of the template\n});\n```\n\nThen, after the {@link RichDisplay} is setup, we return, executing it on a new message.\n\n```javascript\nmodule.exports = class extends Command {\n\n\tasync run(msg) {\n\t\t// ...\n\t\treturn display.run(await msg.sendMessage('Loading slideshow...'));\n\t}\n\n};\n```\n\nThe message will show the content we defined in {@link KlasaMessage.sendMessage} initially, then, when our {@link RichDisplay} will be ready it will replace the content with the first page we defined.\n\n## Info Page\n\nWe can also define an Info page, which will be available through the appropriate reaction emote.\nAll we have to do is simply call the {@link RichDisplay.setInfoPage} instead than {@link RichDisplay.addPage}. The template will be available to us in the same ways as before.\n\n> Note: only one info page can be set at once. Setting the info page more than once will override the previously defined info page.\n\n## Personalization\n\nBehavior managing can be handled through the second (optional) argument of the {@link RichDisplay.run} method.\nThe configuration must be defined as an [object literal](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Object_initializer).\nPlease refer to the {@link RichDisplayRunOptions} documentation page for information about each specific option.\n\n### Custom Behavior Handling\n\nTo handle whether or not a user should trigger an action when interacting with the reactions applied to the embed you can provide a `filter` function, which will be called every time a user reacts to the embed.\n\nA simple example for this would be a filter that only allows the user who executes the command to interact with it:\n\n```javascript\nmodule.exports = class extends Command {\n\n\tasync run(msg) {\n\t\t// ...\n\t\tdisplay.run(await msg.sendMessage('Loading slideshow...'), { filter: (reaction, user) => user === msg.author });\n\t}\n\n};\n```\n","path":"guides/Other Subjects/RichDisplay.md"},"RichMenu":{"name":"Rich Menu","type":"md","content":"While {@tutorial RichDisplay} allows you to create fully configurable paginated embeds, {@link RichMenu} allows you to define menus using a similar interface.\n\nUnlike {@tutorial RichDisplay}, {@link RichMenu} manages a page's content and layout automatically and instead of calling {@link RichDisplay.addPage} that allows to customize the template (if provided), the user is presented with the {@link RichMenu.addOption} method, which only requires a `name` and a `body` and handles the organization of the options automatically.\n\nLike {@tutorial RichDisplay} there is the option to define a template [`MessageEmbed`](https://discord.js.org/#/docs/main/master/class/MessageEmbed) in its constructor, but it will be applied automatically to each page of the menu.\n\nAn example of how {@link RichMenu} could be used is in a `help`-like command, this is a simple demo of how it would work:\n\n```javascript\nmodule.exports = class extends Command {\n\n\tconstructor(...args) {\n\t\tsuper(...args);\n\t\tthis.menu = new RichMenu(new this.client.methods.Embed()\n\t\t\t.setColor(0x673AB7)\n\t\t\t.setAuthor(this.client.user.username, this.client.user.avatarURL())\n\t\t\t.setTitle('Advanced Commands Help:')\n\t\t\t.setDescription('Use the arrow reactions to scroll between pages.\\nUse number reactions to select an option.')\n\t\t);\n\t}\n\n\tasync run(msg) {\n\t\tconst collector = await menu.run(await msg.send('Loading commands...'));\n\n\t\tconst choice = await collector.selection;\n\t\tif (choice === null) {\n\t\t\treturn collector.message.delete();\n\t\t}\n\n\t\tconst command = this.client.commands.get(menu.options[choice].name);\n\t\tconst info = new this.client.methods.Embed()\n\t\t\t.setTitle(`Command \\`${msg.guild.configs.prefix}${command.name}\\``)\n\t\t\t.setDescription(typeof command.description === 'function' ? command.description(msg) : command.description)\n\t\t\t.addField('Usage:', command.usageString);\n\n\t\tif (command.extendedHelp && command.extendedHelp !== '') {\n\t\t\tconst extendHelp = typeof command.extendedHelp === 'function' ? command.extendedHelp(msg) : command.extendedHelp;\n\t\t\tinfo.addField('Help:', extendHelp);\n\t\t}\n\n\t\treturn msg.sendEmbed(info);\n\t}\n\n\tinit() {\n\t\tfor (const command of this.client.commands.values()) {\n\t\t\tthis.menu.addOption(command.name, command.description);\n\t\t}\n\t}\n\n};\n```\n\n> The code is designed to be placed in a command, inside the `async run(msg)` method but the menu or its options can easily be initialized within the constructor method or the {@link Command.init} method of the command.\n\n## Code Analysis\n\nThe creation of the {@link RichMenu} is the same as the one displayed in {@tutorial RichDisplay}, like most of the code and personalization options. Please refer to the {@tutorial RichDisplay} tutorial.\n\nWe begin by adding the options, which will be listed in the same order we defined.\n\n```javascript\nfor (const command of this.client.commands.values()) {\n\tmenu.addOption(command.name, command.description);\n}\n```\n\nAfter listing all the options we can call {@link RichMenu.run} on our menu to render it.\nWe will store the resulting {@link ReactionHandler} to later access the selected option.\n\n```javascript\nmodule.exports = class extends Command {\n\n\tasync run(msg) {\n\t\t// ...\n\t\tconst collector = await menu.run(await msg.send('Loading Commands...'));\n\t\t// ...\n\t}\n\n};\n```\n\nWe will also need to [`await`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/await) for the user to select an option before continuing:\n\n```javascript\nmodule.exports = class extends Command {\n\n\tasync run(msg) {\n\t\t// ...\n\t\tconst choice = await collector.selection;\n\t\t// ...\n\t}\n\n};\n```\n\nAfter obtaining the index of the selected option we can access the option's name through our menu:\n\n```javascript\nconst command = this.client.commands.get(menu.options[choice].name);\n```\n\nFinally, we show the user the selected command by editing the original [`MessageEmbed`](https://discord.js.org/#/docs/main/master/class/MessageEmbed):\n\n```javascript\nconst info = new this.client.methods.Embed()\n\t.setTitle(`Command \\`${msg.guild.configs.prefix}${command.name}\\``)\n\t.setDescription(typeof command.description === 'function' ? command.description(msg) : command.description)\n\t.addField('Usage:', command.usageString);\n\ncollector.message.edit(info);\n```\n\n## Personalization\n\nPersonalization is the same offered by {@tutorial RichDisplay}. You can define an Info Page through {@link RichDisplay.setInfoPage} and you can define custom behavior handling by defining a function in the `filter` argument of {@link RichMenuRunOptions}\n","path":"guides/Other Subjects/RichMenu.md"}}},"Included Pieces":{"name":"Included Pieces","files":{"IncludedCommands":{"name":"Included Commands","type":"md","content":"## Admin / blacklist\n\nAllows bot owners to blacklist users from the bot.\n\n**Source:**\n\n[commands/Admin/blacklist.js](https://github.com/dirigeants/klasa/blob/master/src/commands/Admin/blacklist.js)\n\n## Admin / conf\n\nAllows authorized members to set per guild configuration.\n\n**Source:**\n\n[commands/Admin/conf.js](https://github.com/dirigeants/klasa/blob/master/src/commands/Admin/conf.js)\n\n## Admin / disable\n\nTemporarly global disable any piece except for extendables.
