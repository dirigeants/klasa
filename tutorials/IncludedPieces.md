Klasa includes a number of pieces ({@link Command}, {@link Event}, {@link Finalizer}, {@link Inhibitor}, {@link Language}, {@link Monitor}, {@link Provider}, {@link Task}...) to give any bot a good platform to build on. Any piece can be transfered into your user files and modified without limitation. (If a piece of the same name exists in your user files, it will override the core version of it). Although some pieces should be modified carefully. For instance, if you transfer the message event, and remove the line telling it to run the monitors, no monitor pieces will run on your bot. At the same time, that precisely gives you full control over the bot that __you__ want to run.
